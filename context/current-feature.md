- Project setup and boilerplate cleanup
- Sheets Phase 1 - Ownership on every id route: `Store.JobForUser(id, userID)` replaces `Job(id)`; all four id routes return 404 `Not found` for another account's sheet (same as an unknown id), ownership checked before the upload body is read; `mem` mirrors Postgres; ownership tests incl. owner control check and a read-recording upload body; verified on real Postgres via curl
- Sheets Phase 2 - Start moves a draft to running: `Store.StartJob(id, userID, runID)` does a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE status = 'draft'` and re-reads, so `runId` is chosen once even under concurrent starts; partial unique index `jobs_one_running_per_user` maps by `ConstraintName` to `board.ErrAlreadyRunning` -> 409 `Another sheet is already running`; non-draft sheets come back unchanged with 200; `mem` mirrors Postgres; `TestStartMarksTheJobSuccessful` rewritten to the spec; Postgres integration tests in `internal/store/store_test.go` (skip without `DATABASE_URL`). Known gap left for brochure phase 2: upload's whole-row `UpdateJob` can revert a concurrent start (spec now removes `UpdateJob` and adds `AND filename <> ''` to the start `UPDATE`)
